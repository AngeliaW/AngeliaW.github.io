title: Test Perspective for Mobile App

<br/>Currently most companies which provides mobile apps will support both Android and iOS, so when we talk about mobile app testing, we have to consider both android and iOS.
<br/>Mobile application has 3 types, native app, web app, Hybrid app. Most enterprise apps are hybrid because their mobile apps are only an entry on mobile. End users could use this entry to visit their server like on web but in different user experience. As a mobile app tester, we're not only testing mobile app itself but also integration of mobile app and backend services, even APIs between them.


##Parallel Independent Testing
<br/>Integration testing: is any type of software testing that seeks to verify the interfaces between components against a software design. 
<br/>System testing: tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements and to any external or third party systems defined in the system requirements.
<br/>Regression testing: focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, or old bugs that have come back.
<br/>Smoke test is used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a new build to the main testing process, i.e. before integration or regression.
<br/>Performance testing is executed to determine how fast a system or sub-system performs under a particular workload. It can also serve to validate and verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage.
<br/>Stress testing is primarily concerned with testing that can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that is large quantities of data or a large number of users. 
<br/>Compatibility Testing verifies the application still works with different remote devices.
<br/>Internationalization and localization will verify that the application still works, even after it has been translated into a new language or adapted for a new culture (such as different currencies or time zones).
