        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am Wang Li, graduated from Suzhou University in 2004 and majored in Computer Mathmatics. You can also all me Angelia. I like Mathmatics from my childhood in primary school.
            <br/>My first goal in college is financial.I spent more than 2 years on ecomics courses, but I was totally attracted by operational research in junior period. Then I changed my focus to transportation planning,spent last year in college to try to pass master exam. Not surprisingly, I failed exam. That's why I am programming:-)
            <br/>
            <br/>After graduation, I joined BenQ, a Taiwan company,full of passion at that time. I worked as a software testing engineer in mobile phone development department.With disappear of BenQ-Siemens brand, BenQ's mobile department was separated.50% members including me were transferred to outsourcing business, when I have been working there for nearly 4 years.
            <br/>
            <br/>Like every programmer, I was attracted by Microsoft. As my oral English is not good at that time, I joined but was a vendor,signed a labor contract with another company.I came to shanghai in 2008. I was cheated by that company, so only stayed for 4 months. I still remembered my supervisor in Redmond was very nice. I missed working there.
            <br/>
            <br/>By chance later in 2008, I joined Kodak, worked as an automation testing engineer in PDC(Product Development Center),then as a mobile test lead. This time, I was very lucky. I knew Max and Crab, who are the best manager and supervisor I have been working with until now. I learned a lot from them,grew up very fast in those 4.5 years. For the first time, I set up a new test team, making process/rules, interviewing people, estimating budget,making annual plan, setting up CI machine and so forth. The most important thing that made me benefit is learning to manage product development, writing iOS app and coaching new tester.
            <br/>
            <br/>I had great colleagues and friends in Kodak. Unluckily Kodak went bankruptcy protection in 2012. The most important business AiO was closed and another business Kodak Gallary was sold. Businesses mobile team's responsible for was cut and my team was also cut.After insisting on a year, I started thinking about myself. If continue staying there, there will be less grow-up. It's time to say goodbye, I choose to pursue new challenge.
            <br/>
            <br/>I joined EF in March,2013, worked in EF labs, as a member of a very cool team, Mobile Team, with geek guys from different countries. I am the 3rd member of android team, 1st tester. Now we have more and more new members. I really appreciated to join this team, especailly Android team, which is the best team I have been working with. We have efficient team-spirit, flexible corporation, kindly developers,who always provide kinds of helps to testers. We have a kind team leader Anton, who is an excellent tech leader, so kind, so humor...
            <br/>
            <br/>I am always lucky that why I grew up fast. My second chance to set up a test team,a super strong test team, each member is talent. In the beginning, we only have 2 testers including myself. With help of my manager, we interviewed and invited 3 more testers. I enjoy working here, still full of passion on Apple products. The next goal is Apple:-)
