        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
        <p></p>
            <p>My name is Wang Li (use English name Angelia at work).I graduated from Suzhou University and my major is Computer Mathmatics. I like Mathmatics from my childhood when studying in primary school.
            <br/>My first goal in college is financial and spent more than 2 years to study ecomics courses. However, one day during Junior period, I was totally attracted by operational research.I changed my goal to transportation planning and tried my best in last year of college to pass master exam. Unfortunately, I failed the exam. That's why I am programming:-)
            <br/>After graduation, I joined BENQ, a Taiwan company full of passion at that time.In 2008, I came to Shanghai, attracted by Microsoft but my oral English is really bad. Finally I joined as vendor but have to sign a labor contract with another company. When I came to shanghai and signed contract with that company, I know cheating for the first time. I was cheated, so I stayed there 4 months only. My leader in US is also very nice, I really missed that Microsoft in 2008.
            <br/>I joined Kodak and worked in PDC(Product Development Center) by chance. Thanks god, I am very lucky. I met Max and Crab, who are the best manager and supervisor I have been working with. I learned a lot from them and grew up fast in those 4.5 years. The first time I set up a new team, the first time I lead a totally new project there. I learned how to use Axure, learned to write iOS code, learned to set up CI machine. The most important and benifit for me, I know how to set up process/rules to make team members to follow, I know hot to interview people, how to estimate budget,how to make annual plan, etc.
            <br/>I am lucky I met best colleagues and friends in Kodak, but unluckily Kodak went bankruptcy protection in 2012. The most important business AiO was closed and another business Kodak Gallary I was working for was sold. My team was cut from 10 to 5. I insisted on a year. More and more businesses were closed, I started to think about myself. Of course I can continue staying there but less grow-up. It's time to say goodbye. I have to pursue my new challenge.
            <br/>I joined EF in March,2013, worked in EFlabs, as a member of a very cool team, Mobile Team,with geek guys from different countries. I am the 3rd member of android team, 1st tester.Now we have more and more new members. I really appreciated to join this team, especailly Android team, which is the best team I have been working with. We have efficient team-spirit, flexible corporation, kindly developers,who always provide kinds of helps to testers. We have a kind team leader Anton, who is an excellent tech leader, so kind, so humor...
            <br/>I always said I am very lucky. My second chance to set up a test team, even only 2 testers at the beginning. With help of my manager, we interviewed and invited 3 more testers.A super strong test team, each member is talent. I enjoy working here,full of passion on Apple products. The next goal is Apple:-)
