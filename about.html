##About me

My name is Wang Li (use English name Angelia at work).
I graduated from Suzhou University and my major is Computer Mathmatics. I like Mathmatics from my childhood when studying in primary school.
My first goal in college is financial and spent more than 2 years to study ecomics courses. However, one day during Junior period, I was totally attracted by operational research. 
I changed my goal to transportation planning and tried my best in last year of college to pass master exam. Unfortunately, I failed the exam.

After graduation, I joined BENQ, a Taiwan company full of passion at that time. Here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/angelia-wang/2b/a41/171">resume on Linkedin</a>
